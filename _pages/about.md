I am a PhD student at the Institute for Social Sciences at 
Osnabr√ºck University.

My interests cover a range of topics in Comparative Politics. I study political attitudes and behavior in the context of contention, autocratic politics, and regime change. In my research I mostly rely on causal inference designs using observational data as well as survey experiments.
