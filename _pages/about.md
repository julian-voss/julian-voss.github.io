I am a PhD student at the Institute for Social Sciences at Osnabrück University, where I am part of the [Comparative Politics](https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/fb1/sozialwissenschaften/en/main-menu-1/fachgebiete/political-science/comparative-political-science) research group.

My interests cover a range of topics in Comparative Politics. I study political attitudes and behavior in the context of contention, political violence, and autocratic politics. In my research I mostly rely on causal inference designs using observational data as well as survey experiments.
