<p align="justify">

Prior research suggests that punitive transitional justice (TJ) may foster a sense of collective exoneration among members of perpetrator groups, potentially reducing support for remembrance of ingroup atrocities in the long-term. We employ a two-part empirical strategy to test this potential “hidden cost’’ of TJ in Germany: a vignette experiment manipulating perceptions of the extent of the denazification process and an observational analysis exploiting variance in denazification intensity across occupation zones. Our results reveal that while perceptions of comprehensive Nazi accountability translate into a belief that the entire German in-group has been held accountable, these perceptions do not affect attitudes towards ongoing commemoration or responsibility towards victim groups. Our robust null finding demonstrates that perceptions of justice being served do not undermine support for historical closure on mass violence. These results contribute to the broader literature on TJ’s long-term attitudinal impacts and the determinants of support for historical remembrance, emphasizing the enduring importance of moral over legal perceptions of accountability.

How does right-wing terrorism affect electoral support for populist radical right parties (PRRPs)? Recent research has produced contrary answers to this question. We argue that only high-intensity attacks, whose motives and targets mirror PRRPs’ nativist agenda, are likely to generate a media backlash that dampens electoral support for PRRPs. We test this argument by combining high-frequency survey and social media data with a natural and survey experimental design. We find that right-wing terror reduced support for the radical right party Alternative für Deutschland after one of the most intense nativist attacks in recent German history. An analysis of all ninety-eight fatal right-wing attacks in Germany between 1990 and 2020 supports our argument. Our findings contribute to an understanding of how political violence triggers partisan detachment and have important implications for media responsibility in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.

### German Post-War Election Database (GPWED). Accepted for publication, *Nature: Scientific Data*.

<details>

<summary>Description</summary>

<p align="justify">

Historical social science research on the electoral politics of transitional countries is often undermined by a lack of disaggregated, fine-grained election data. This paper presents the first national database of municipal-level results for one of the most notable cases of a transition to democracy in recent history: Post World War II West Germany. Spanning the country's initial six federal elections between 1949 and 1969, the data covers significant historical developments such as the early phase of economic reconstruction and recovery, the social and political integration of millions of Germans expelled from the former eastern territories, the beginning judicial confrontation with the crimes of the Nazi regime, and the emergence of radical left-wing activism during the 1960s. The database will allow future research to address important questions on topics such as democratization, the dynamics of post-authoritarian and post-war politics, and the long-term evolution of electoral politics in one of Europe's most populous nations.

How do voters react to challenges of collective memories? We study the controversial "Wehrmacht exhibition" (1995–1999), which exposed the German public to graphic evidence challenging the ``myth of the clean Wehrmacht'' - the false narrative that only the SS, not the military, systematically committed war crimes and perpetrated the Holocaust. To study the exhibition's effects, we leverage survey data of over 830,000 voters in a staggered difference-in-differences setup. We complement this analysis with evidence from over 1,200 letters to the editor, an original survey of Germans born around the end of WWII, and interviews with public figures who spoke at exhibition openings. We find that the exhibition triggered political backlash, particularly among the children of WWII soldiers. However, this backlash was localized and short-lived. We also show that the exhibition effectively shifted public discourse on the Wehrmacht, demonstrating that memory entrepreneurs can overturn self-serving narratives without lasting political repercussions.

<p align="justify">

Measuring regime support in closed autocracies is notoriously challenging due to preference falsification, state censorship, and pervasive propaganda. We introduce a novel behavioral measure of regime loyalty based on subtle expressions of allegiance in soldier obituaries published in Nazi Germany between 1939 and 1945. Our empirical analysis draws on a large-scale dataset of over one million scanned pages from roughly 160,000 newspaper issues across 260 unique local news outlets. Using Large Language Models for OCR and data labeling, we detect expressions of regime support, such as praise for Hitler, National Socialism, or the Fatherland, in approximately 600,000 obituaries. Our approach yields the first spatially and temporally granular measure of Nazi regime support during World War II. Our descriptive findings nuance the prevailing historical consensus: we find that regime loyalty began to erode immediately following the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, not after the Battle of Stalingrad. By contrast, militaristic rhetoric emphasizing soldiers' heroism persisted at high levels throughout the war.

### Political Purges and Social Ties: Evidence From Denazification

<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

<p align="justify">

How do social ties between administrators and defendants affect the
implementation of personnel transitional justice policies? To address
issues of inherited personnel, countries undergoing transitions from
autocratic rule frequently implement mechanisms like purges or criminal
trials. While a considerable number of studies investigates the
consequences of these policies, less is known about factors that shape
their implementation. Building on insights from administration research,
I analyze how differences in social ties shape the outcomes of a mass
purge by drawing on data of approx. 50000 denazification trials from
British occupied Nazi Germany. I investigate the effects of two
different forms of ties: social identity and networks. I leverage
variation regarding the level of ties between administrators and
defendants resulting from the delegation of denazification to German
authorities and defendants' different migratory backgrounds. My results
point to an ambivalent effect of ties in the context of transitional
justice policies: while identity ties lead to more lenient ruling,
network ties seem to have the opposite effect. The study's findings shed
new light on transitional justice and the persistence of political
personnel in the shadow of dictatorship.

### Information about Corruption and Voting Behavior: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Germany

<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

<p align="justify">

How do voters respond to information about corruption? Research
investigating electoral responses to corruption has thus far generated
mixed results and research in this area generally faces a number of
methodological problems. While observational studies linking aggregate
corruption levels and political behavior usually raise concerns about
endogeneity, experimental methods may suffer from problems like social
desirability bias or a lack of external validity. In this paper, I
bypass these issues by analyzing a natural experiment generated by a
corruption scandal around the procurement of face masks during the
COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. I exploit the differential exposure to the
corruption scandal of mail and ballot-box voters prior to a major
regional election in a difference-in-differences design. Comparing
electoral outcomes across mail and ballot-box electorates in 1109
municipalities over time, I find that corruption leads to a reduction of
the affected party's vote share of approximately 5% in the exposed
electorate. Furthermore, I find similar effects for the party's
coalition partner indicating that corruption may produce negative
spillovers for other incumbent parties. This study sheds new light on
corruption and voting behavior by showing that misconduct by public
officials can produce substantive electoral responses that have the
potential to move well beyond an affected party.
