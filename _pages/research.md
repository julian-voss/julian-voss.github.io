### Political Purges and Social Ties: Evidence From Denazification

<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

<p align="justify">

How do social ties between administrators and defendants affect the
implementation of personnel transitional justice policies? To address
issues of inherited personnel, countries undergoing transitions from
autocratic rule frequently implement mechanisms like purges or criminal
trials. While a considerable number of studies investigates the
consequences of these policies, less is known about factors that shape
their implementation. Building on insights from administration research,
I analyze how differences in social ties shape the outcomes of a mass
purge by drawing on data of approx. 50000 denazification trials from
British occupied Nazi Germany. I investigate the effects of two
different forms of ties: social identity and networks. I leverage
variation regarding the level of ties between administrators and
defendants resulting from the delegation of denazification to German
authorities and defendants' different migratory backgrounds. My results
point to an ambivalent effect of ties in the context of transitional
justice policies: while identity ties lead to more lenient ruling,
network ties seem to have the opposite effect. The study's findings shed
new light on transitional justice and the persistence of political
personnel in the shadow of dictatorship.

Prior research suggests that punitive transitional justice (TJ) may foster a sense of collective exoneration among members of perpetrator groups, potentially reducing support for remembrance of ingroup atrocities in the long-term. We employ a two-part empirical strategy to test this potential “hidden cost’’ of TJ in Germany: a vignette experiment manipulating perceptions of the extent of the denazification process and an observational analysis exploiting variance in denazification intensity across occupation zones. Our results reveal that while perceptions of comprehensive Nazi accountability translate into a belief that the entire German in-group has been held accountable, these perceptions do not affect attitudes towards ongoing commemoration or responsibility towards victim groups. Our robust null finding demonstrates that perceptions of justice being served do not undermine support for historical closure on mass violence. These results contribute to the broader literature on TJ’s long-term attitudinal impacts and the determinants of support for historical remembrance, emphasizing the enduring importance of moral over legal perceptions of accountability.

How do voters react to challenges of established collective memories? We study the controversial "Wehrmacht Exhibition'' (1995–1999), which, for the first time, exposed the German public to graphic evidence of WWII war crimes committed by the German military. This traveling exhibition challenged the widespread "myth of the clean Wehrmacht'', the false post-war narrative that only the SS, not the military, systematically committed war crimes and perpetrated the Holocaust. To study how different segments of the electorate reacted to the exhibition, we leverage high-frequency survey data of more than 830,000 voters in a staggered difference-in-differences setup. We complement this analysis with descriptive evidence from over 1.200 letters to the editor. We find that the exhibition triggered political backlash, especially among the sons of WWII soldiers. However, this backlash is localized and short-lived. Our results highlight the conditions under which memory entrepreneurs may challenge established narratives without incurring long-term political costs.

How does right-wing terrorism affect electoral support for populist radical right parties
(PRRP)? Recent research has produced contrary answers to this question. We argue that
only high-profile attacks, whose motives and targets mirror PRRPs’ nativist agenda are likely
to generate a media backlash that dampens electoral support for PRRPs. We test this argu-
ment combining high-frequency survey and social media data with a natural and survey
experimental design. We find that right-wing terror reduced support for the right-wing
populist party Alternative für Deutschland after one of the most intense nativist attacks in
recent German history. A case comparison with three other high-profile attacks and an
analysis of all 98 fatal right-wing attacks in Germany between 1990 and 2020 support our
argument. Our findings help to understand how political violence triggers partisan detach-
ment and have important implications for media responsibility in the aftermath of terrorist
attacks.

### Information about Corruption and Voting Behavior: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Germany

<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

<p align="justify">

How do voters respond to information about corruption? Research
investigating electoral responses to corruption has thus far generated
mixed results and research in this area generally faces a number of
methodological problems. While observational studies linking aggregate
corruption levels and political behavior usually raise concerns about
endogeneity, experimental methods may suffer from problems like social
desirability bias or a lack of external validity. In this paper, I
bypass these issues by analyzing a natural experiment generated by a
corruption scandal around the procurement of face masks during the
COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. I exploit the differential exposure to the
corruption scandal of mail and ballot-box voters prior to a major
regional election in a difference-in-differences design. Comparing
electoral outcomes across mail and ballot-box electorates in 1109
municipalities over time, I find that corruption leads to a reduction of
the affected party's vote share of approximately 5% in the exposed
electorate. Furthermore, I find similar effects for the party's
coalition partner indicating that corruption may produce negative
spillovers for other incumbent parties. This study sheds new light on
corruption and voting behavior by showing that misconduct by public
officials can produce substantive electoral responses that have the
potential to move well beyond an affected party.
